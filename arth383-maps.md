# Icebreaker
How/when/why do you encounter maps? Do you have a favorite map? 

# Goals
* understand the basics of web maps
* think critically about the maps around us and in DH projects
* learn how to add your text to the Florence map

# Activity
1. On your own, draw a map of campus. 

# Discussion
* What story does your map tell? 
* What choices did you have to make? 
* What is left out of your map? 
* How does it compare to official W&L maps? 

# What is spatial history? 
[Richard White and Henri Lefebvre](https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29&project_id) say:

1. spatial practice
2. representations of space
3. representational space

# 
> GIS is itself a representational space, but its users and sometimes its creators seem oblivious of its representational aspects. - Richard White

# types of maps 
* digital maps 
* web maps
* narrative maps
* data driven maps
* spatial analysis maps

# web map principles	
* Layers (base, raster, vector, data)
* Conforming to spatial grid
* Unaware of time?
* User aware
* Tiles 
* See [Anatomy of a Web Map](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map) for more. 

# mapping tools
* ArcGIS
* Google Maps
* MapWarper 
* StoryMapJS
* Carto
* Neatline


# Activity
1. With a partner, explore your assigned project. 
* [Mapping the Second KKK](https://labs.library.vcu.edu/klan/)
* [Visualizing Emancipation](http://dsl.richmond.edu/emancipation/) 
* [Photogrammar](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/map/)
* [Slave Voyages](https://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/maps)
* [The Atlantic Current](http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/)


# Activity
2. Consider the following questions:
	* What argument does this map make?
	* How does it communicate its argument?
	* What do you have to know in advance to understand this map?
	* What tech/data is this map using? 


# Florence Map

# We need:
* location information
* and coordinates (lat/long)
* as structured data
* in a plain text format (CSV)

# Activity 
1. Open the Google Spreadsheet link in your email. 
2. Fill out the fields with your building information. 
3. Download the spreadsheet as CSV to your computer.

# Activity 
4. Create a free ArcGIS.com account. 
5. Select ```Map``` or "Make a Map" to create your own. 
6. Choose Add > Add Layer from File to select your CSV file. 
7. Check your map for data errors and customize as you choose!
8. Make sure to save your map if you want to come back later. 

# Activity
* Can you figure out how to change the basemap?
* Can you figure out how to color the pins by category? 
* Can you figure out how to add the Buonsignori map?
