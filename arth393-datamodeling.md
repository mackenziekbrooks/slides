# What is data?

# What is data? 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data): "Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools. Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing."

# What is data?
[School of Data](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/what-is-data/): "Data is a value assigned to a thing."

# Pets Table
|Animal|Name|Breed|
|---|---|---|
|Cat|Huxley|Tabby cat|
|Cat|Orwell|Demon|
|Dog|Harper|Retriever|


# Where do you encounter data? 

# How does data work in the humanities? 

#
[Schöch](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-3/big-smart-clean-messy-data-in-the-humanities/): "a digital, selectively constructed, machine-actionable abstraction representing some aspects of a given object of humanistic inquiry."

# 
[Owens](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/defining-data-for-humanists-by-trevor-owens/): 1) Constructed artifacts 2) interpretable texts 3) processable information

# Examples
* [PeriodO](http://perio.do/en/)
* [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/)
* [Ancient Graffiti Project](http://ancientgraffiti.org/)
* [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)
* [For Better For Verse](http://prosody.lib.virginia.edu/)
* [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/network/)

# So, what do the computers want? 

# Computers want:
* structure 
* consistency 
* conciseness 

# How do we do it? 

# Data modeling

# 
[Sperberg-McQueen](https://juliaflanders.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/flanders_jannidis_data_modeling.pdf): "modeling is a way to make explicit our assumptions about the nature of a text/artefact."

#
[Weingart](http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=6279): "humanists care more about the differences than the regularities."

# How do we ask questions? 

# 
```SELECT * FROM Pets WHERE Animal = "Cat";```


# What does a data model of W&L look like? 


# Activity 
In groups of three, create a data model for the city of Florence.
