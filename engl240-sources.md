# stump your neighbor!
To test your skills evaluating sources, you will find some scholarly and non-scholarly sources, then see if your classmate can tell the difference.

# step 1
Create an account on [http://www.zotero.org](http://www.zotero.org). Use your university user name to make things easy.

# step 2
Join the Zotero Group Library for this class: 
[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2300429/wlu-engl240-w19](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2300429/wlu-engl240-w19)

# step 3
Start your search. Using the library's search engine, the academic databases, or Google, find an article on a topic related to Gawain or *The Buried Giant*. 

# step 4 
Once you've found a relevant source, add it to the Zotero Group Library using the green plus sign. Make sure you include the title, author, publisher, URL and other important information. 

# step 5
Add at least two sources to the group library. One should be scholarly and one should not be (by your estimation). 

# step 6
Share your articles with a neighbor. Take time to look at the article metadata as well as the article itself. Label each article as "scholarly" or "not-scholarly" by tagging it with your guess. 

# step 7
Compare notes! Were you right? How could you tell? Was there ambiguity?
