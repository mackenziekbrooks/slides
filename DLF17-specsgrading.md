# Context

* Teaching solo
* 12 weeks, 3 credits
* Housed in DH dept

# Audience 
* All majors, all years
* Grade conscious, rubric demanding
* Uncomfortable with ambiguity
* Self-labeled "bad at technology"

# Some Goals
* Confidence building
* Domains in public
* Project management
* Focus on methods
* Metacognition

# Harder goals

* Iteration
* Experimentation 

# Specifications Grading

# Promises
* Combat grade anxiety
* Increase student responsibility
* Increase rigor
* Match learning outcomes
* Reduce time spent grading

# How it works
* Assignments are pass/fail
* Clear, detailed specifications 
* Specs = B-level work
* Bundles + modules
* Tokens/free pass
* No partial credit

# Implementation
* Unit 1: Text
* Unit 2: Network
* Unit 3: Space

# Example

## Project visualization specs:
```
* Due Tuesday 10/10 by 2:30pm.
* Embed/publish on your website.
* Indicate which tool/method you used to produce this visualization.
* Include 150-300 words on why you selected this visualization.

     * What did you learn about your data from this visualization, if anything?
     * What about the visualization/methodology worked or didn't work?
     * Are there issues with the data that the visualization illuminates or disguises?
     * Did this method of visualization require you to modify your data in a specific way?
```

# What Works
* Word count privileges analysis + reflection
* Repeated bundles creates opportunity to enact reflections
* Specs disguise ambiguity for students 
* Keeps me away from math

# What needs improvement
* Awareness/use of free passes 
* Specs can always be better 
* Commit to specs
* +/-

# Anonymous student quote
> Mastery is not synonymous with accomplishment and confusion or lack of understanding is not synonymous with failure. Embracing this fact seems like a good starting point for improving my relationship with technology, for now.
