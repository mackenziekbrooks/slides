# Context 
* New course: DH 102 Data in the Humanities
* Teaching solo
* 12 weeks, 3 credits
* Housed in DH dept

# Audience 
* All majors, all years
* Grade conscious, rubric demanding
* Uncomfortable with ambiguity
* Self-labeled "bad at technology"

# Some Goals
* Confidence building
* Domains
* Metacognition
* DH methods 
* Project management 

# Harder goals
* Inclusive pedagogy
* Productive failure 
* Iteration
* Experimentation 

# Specifications Grading

# Promises
* Combat grade anxiety
* Increase student responsibility
* Increase rigor
* Reduce grade inflation
* Match learning outcomes
* Reduce time spent grading

# How it works
* Assignments are pass/fail
* Clear, detailed specifications 
* Specs = B-level work
* Bundle + modules
* Token/free pass

# Implementation
* Unit 1: Text
* Unit 2: Network
* Unit 3: Space

# Assignments

Core|Advanced

# Assignments

# Example

## Project visualization specs:
* Due Tuesday 10/10 by 2:30pm.
* Embed/publish on your website.
* Indicate which tool/method you used to produce this visualization.
* Include 150-300 words on why you selected this visualization.

     * What did you learn about your data from this visualization, if anything?
     * What about the visualization/methodology worked or didn't work?
     * Are there issues with the data that the visualization illuminates or disguises?
     * Did this method of visualization require you to modify your data in a specific way?

# What Works
* Word count privileges analysis + reflection
* Repeated bundles creates opportunity to enact reflections
* Appearance of rubric 

# What needs improvement
* Awareness/use of free passes 
* Specs can always be better 
* Commit to specs

# Anonymous student quote
> Mastery is not synonymous with accomplishment and confusion or lack of understanding is not synonymous with failure. Embracing this fact seems like a good starting point for improving my relationship with technology, for now.

# Include!
* Often the quality assignments are from students who are bringing outside skills/stuff to the classroom. 
* We expect students to know the forms/templates through example but not explicit instruction 
* grades should reflect height and number of hurdles 
* be selective to match LO
* student work example
* multiple reflections gives time to implement 



The DH community values the concept of “productive failure." But how do we model and reward this concept for students in the confines of a course? This presentation will describe an alternative grading system known as “Specifications Grading” and its use in two iterations of an undergraduate DH course.


The DH community values the concept of “productive failure." Breaking tools or playing around with methodologies deepens our skills in ways that strictly following a tutorial cannot. As researchers, this behavior is encouraged as part of the research process and documented on blogs and social media. But how do we model this concept for students in a meaningful way? How do we reward their own productive failure within the confines of a course? Not only are undergraduates newcomers to both traditional and digital research methodologies, they arrive with varying levels of technology experience. Some have too much confidence in their abilities while others do not have enough. On some campuses, students are extremely grade conscious and demand detailed rubrics for even the most experimental assignments. Designing engaging and fair assignments in this context is a challenge.

This presentation will describe an alternative grading system known as “Specifications Grading” and its use in an undergraduate DH course. From the student perspective, this system aims to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. From the instructor perspective, Specs Grading is intended to reduce grading time and force assignments to actually reflect learning objectives. In a DH course, Specs Grading works by requiring and assessing student work on individual phases of methodology, rather than the final product. The presentation will provide an overview of the grading system, its use in a 2016 course, and revisions to the system for a second offering of the course in fall 2017.
